Additional Packages
*******************

   Eli is a collection of "packages" that define sets of tools and
workflow patterns.  The actual generation process is handled by "Odin",
a program designed to manage a collection of artifacts and tools to
provide products that are up-to-date with respect to all of the raw
material on which they are based.

   Many of the packages included in the Eli distribution define tools
and workflow patterns that, although they support text-processor
generation, are useful for other applications.  Version 4.6 simplifies
the processes of modifying existing packages and of adding new
packages to take advantage of these facilities.

   We are also making additional packages available individually in
conjunction with the standard Eli distribution.  These additional
packages are distributed as tar files whose names begin with `pkg-'.

   For those interested in constructing their own packages, the best
reference is the book `Generating Software from Specifications' (see
`http://www.jbpub.com/catalog/0763741248/').

New `eli' Parameter
*******************

   We have added a parameter `-p `dir'' to the `eli' command (*note
Packages in the cache: (sysadmin)Capability.).  Here `dir' is the
absolute path name of a directory containing either a package or a
package collection (*note Package Management: (sysadmin)Packages.).

   An `eli' command may have any number of `-p' parameters, which are
considered in order from left to right.  They are effective only when
the cache specified by the `eli' command does not exist, or when it is
being rebuilt because the `-R' parameter is also given.  In either
case, the package(s) specified are added to the set of packages to be
used in building the cache (*note Cache Management: (sysadmin)Caches.).

The `installpkg' Product
************************

   The standard Eli packages can be installed in a library that can be
updated without affecting any caches currently being used (*note
Installation: (sysadmin)Install.).  Updates only take effect if a new
cache is created or an existing cache is reset by executing and `eli'
command on that cache with the `-R' parameter.

   We have added the `installpkg' product to allow users to install
additional packages in the standard library or to create their own
libraries (*note Installing additional packages:
(sysadmin)PkgInstall.).  To take advantage of this facility, the
packages must be "versioned" (*note Versioned packages:
(sysadmin)Versioning.).
