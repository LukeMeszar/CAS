This module uses the C module PreDefMod to provide functions for 
predefining source identifiers (PreDefineSym) and for
establishing bindings for predefined source identifiers (PreDefineSym).
Instatiation of this module also sets the identifier encoding
to be used for identifier entries made by those functions.

This module is used in cooperation with the module PreDefId.
The C module PreDefMod can also be used independent of this module.

The function TypePreDefine adds an identifer to
the identifier module and binds it to a key in an environment.
The function TypePreDefineSym only adds an identifer to
the identifier module without binding it to a key.

The generic instance parameter Type indicates the environment.
The identifier code is given by the generic referto parameter ident.
