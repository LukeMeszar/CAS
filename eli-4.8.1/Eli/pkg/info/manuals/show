SHOW - A LIDO Table Viewer
**************************

   The LIGA module "show" translates internal representations of LIDO
text into readable text. The text contains information about the
symbols, attributes, computations and visit-sequences of the LIDO
text. This information helps the user to learn what is LIGA's view of
the given LIDO text, especially for tracing errors.

   The show module can be applied to the output (*_idl) of any LIGA
phase.  In Eli it is activated by the derivations
     :showFe:viewlist, :showMe:viewlist
   These requests start a shell in a directory, containing three
generated files:

`symbols.info'
     contains a `TERM' and a `NONTERM' specification mentioning all
     grammar symbols of the AG.

     It helps to find symbols which are not intended to be terminals.

`attrs.info'
     contains the attribute specifications for each symbol. Type and
     class are given for each attribute, additionally its visit number,
     the storage decision, and the origin of the attribute - if that
     information exists.

     This information is helpful to get an overview about the
     attributes and their properties, and to find attributes which
     have a misspelled name.

`visit.info'
     contains the visit-sequence for each production.  It is just the
     set of operations if the input to show was not processed by order. 
Both files `symbols.info' & `attrs.info' are LIDO text which might be
added to a LIDO file.

   All source code references contained in the files have the form
`(Fi:line:col)' where `Fi' is a reference to the original source file
name listed in the header of the file.
