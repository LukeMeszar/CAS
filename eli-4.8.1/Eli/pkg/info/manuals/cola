Introduction
************

   In ELI you can use different parser generators, namely COLA or PGS. 
By default ELI uses the PGS parser generator. In order to specify the
COLA parser, add an option after the `.specs'-filename in the ELI
derivation command. For example, you can write

        myfile.specs +parser='cola' :source > src

if you want to use the COLA-Parser-Generator. If you use COLA as your
parser generator, you can modify the behavior of COLA by specifing
options in a `.cola'-file.  Seperate the options with white space.
(e.g. put every option in one line by itself.)  You can add comments
using C-style-comments or AWK-Comments. Add this filename to your
`.specs'-file. That's all.

   In the next section all the options that can be used in that file
will be described.

Options
*******

INFO ON/OFF

   A derivation of `:parsable' will produce the complete state tables.
Default is, that COLA generates only information whether the grammar
is LALR(1) or not. If it is not, COLA will print the conflict states. 
Switching this option on will get you information on all the states
with all productions and symbols of the grammar.

FREE POS ON/OFF

   Switching on this option gives you additional information about free
positions in the grammar. This information can be used for parse time
evaluation. Free positions in a grammer can be filled with connections
without destroying the LALR(1)-property.

   For the current installation of Cola this option has no effect.

ERROR AUTOMATIC ON/OFF

   With this option you can specify if the parser should continue or
stop after a syntax error. This option is turned on by default.
(meaning that the parser should continue after a syntax error)

OPT INFO ON/OFF

   If you enable this option, a derivation of `:colaOptInfo' in ELI
will contain the optimisation results from the COLA backend. By
default, this option is switched off.

TTAB <mode>

   This option has effect on the optimisation of the parser tables.
Please refer to  "Optimization of Parser Tables for Portable
Compilers", P.Denker, K.Duerre and J.Heuft, TOPLAS 6(4), Page 564-572,
1984. `mode' can be one of the following:

`GCSA'
`GCSB'
     Graph Coloring Scheme

`LESA'
`LESB'
     Line Elemination Scheme

`RCSA'
`RCSB'
     Row Column Scheme

`SDS'
     Significant Distance Scheme

`RDS'
     Row Displacement Scheme

NTAB <mode>

   Analoguous to the terminal table this option effects the
nonterminal table.  `mode' can have the same values as above.
